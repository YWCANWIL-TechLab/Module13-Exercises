            <h1>Module 13: Classes and OOP</h1>
            <p>This module mostly covers Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is one of the two
                major paradigms in programming in 2023. Object-Oriented Programming is based around creating object
                blueprints, called Classes. OOP creates many objects that all have the same properties and methods.
                OOP is very useful for solving problems where you need to objects to model a situation. For example,
                every Netflix account is able to do the same couple of things and holds the same information about
                each user. You could represent this using a class called Account, which has your Name, Account 
                Number, Payment Info, and Movie Preferences (Netflix's actual Account class likely has many more
                properties and methods).
